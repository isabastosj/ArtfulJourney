# Artful Journey - Swift Student Challenge 2023

## Project Description

**Artful Journey** is an iOS game where players guide an artist capybara around Curitiba’s monuments, creating along the way. The game combines creativity and fun, encouraging users to explore artistic expression while learning about local culture.

I developed this project as part of the **2023 Swift Student Challenge** at WWDC, and I’m proud to say it was selected as a winner! The game offers an educational experience with a charming and playful protagonist: the capybara.

## Development Process

The development of **Artful Journey** was a journey in itself. From brainstorming to prototyping and final adjustments, I aimed to make the game as engaging and polished as possible, all while pushing myself to learn new skills in Swift and SwiftUI.

### Key Development Steps:
- **Design**: I started by sketching the user interface and creating low-fidelity wireframes using Figma. The capybara character and environmental assets were drawn in MediBangPaint, and I used SwiftUI for the interface design.
- **Game Mechanics**: The game mechanics were built using SwiftUI and Core Graphics. The player controls the capybara as it moves through the city and paints monuments, all while facing challenges.
- **Testing**: I tested the game thoroughly with friends and family, gathering feedback to make improvements and ensure it was both fun and educational.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

Developing this project was both challenging and rewarding. Here are some lessons I learned along the way:

- **Time Management**: Balancing my studies with the development of the game was difficult, but I learned how to prioritize tasks and stay focused under pressure.
- **UI Design**: I faced several challenges when designing the user interface, especially in terms of making the game’s controls intuitive. SwiftUI was a great tool for achieving a clean and functional design.
- **Creative Problem Solving**: There were moments when I had to be creative, finding new ways to implement features within the limited time available.

## Why You Should Participate

Participating in the Swift Student Challenge is a great opportunity to challenge yourself and build something amazing. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, the process of creating a project from start to finish will teach you invaluable skills, and it’s a great way to build your portfolio.

Don’t worry about making your project perfect—focus on progress and learning. If I can do it, so can you!
